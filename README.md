## WebSockets Tandem Control  
Welcome to the WebSockets Tandem Control project â€“ where coding meets coordination! ðŸš€ðŸŽ®  

This project leverages WebSockets to create a dynamic and interactive experience. You'll be controlling two circles on your screen using separate remote control connections. Dive into the code, synchronize the moves, and enjoy the thrill of tandem control.  

Technologies Used:  
WebSockets: Establish real-time communication channels.  
HTML5 Canvas: Render dynamic circles on the screen.  
JavaScript: Script the magic behind the synchronized controls.  

Experience the fun by connecting two remote controls and witness the circles dance in tandem.  

Watch a mini demo below!
